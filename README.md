# CKAD-bookmarks
Bookmarks for the exam, exam information and collection of labs.

# How to use

Import ckad-bookmarks.html into your favourite browser bookmarks.

## The CKAD folder 

Contains only bookmarks to allowed subdomain https://kubernetes.io/docs and is categorized as close as possible to the [Domain & Competencies sections](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/ckad-program-change-2021/)

I tried to keep it as simple as possible, where possible include an imperative example and a declarative template.

- Imperatives look like 'k create deploy'.
- Declarative examples are prefixed with **
- Anything else is a generic long form explanation.

## The Info folder

Useful official information about the exam, such as T&C's, current k8s version in the exam and a minikube reference (I use this for my labbing).

## The Labs folder

A collection of labs found around the internet.
